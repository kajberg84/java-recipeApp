### Working

Everything for passing grade is working as intented.

### Test cases

Ofcourse always did manually testing and console log to track the errors but since we where supposed to use at least one automatic testcase thats what i did. Using gradle.
I actually liked it so Im gonna implement that in the future also.

### Own Thoughts

I wanted to use some arraylists and maps just to get the practise and to try to challenge myself. After a while I understood that this was maybe not the best for a beginner in Java... BUT after googling and googling and googling everything can me fixed and now I am really proud over my Recipe application. It was alot bigger and more coding than I thought in beforehand as you can se in intended.md. But I am a learning student and thats exactly what I did. Learned alot.
